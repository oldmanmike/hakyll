# hakyll

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jaspervdj/hakyll.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jaspervdj/hakyll)

Hakyll is a static site generator library in Haskell. More information
(including a tutorial) can be found on
[the hakyll homepage](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll).

You can install this library using cabal:

    cabal install hakyll

Or by using [stack](https://www.stackage.org):

    stack install

For stack, if you encounter [this issue](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/823) then you'll need to make sure your build of stack is recent enough to have its fix, [603c791](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/commit/603c7916d02c7c7a17478a0b6c19870293f2173e).
